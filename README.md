# RKI_1341_20A_dc_motor_driver_arduino
in this repo we can have code of the dual dc motor driver namely RKI_1341 it is 20A driver 
in this project {
  The RKI1341 20A dual DC motor driver is a hardware module that can be used to control two DC motors simultaneously. This module is designed to be interfaced with an Arduino board, and it can be connected to the board through three pins: dir, pwm, and brk.

The dir pin is used to set the direction of the motor rotation, and it can be connected to digital pin 8 on the Arduino board. The pwm pin is used to control the speed of the motor, and it can be connected to digital pin 9 on the board. The brk pin is used to apply the brake to the motor, and it can be connected to digital pin 10 on the board.

By connecting the RKI1341 driver to an Arduino board and using the appropriate software library, it is possible to control the speed and direction of two DC motors with ease. The driver is capable of handling up to 20A of current, making it suitable for a wide range of motor applications.

Overall, the RKI1341 20A dual DC motor driver is a powerful and versatile hardware module that can be easily integrated with an Arduino board. It provides an efficient way to control multiple DC motors, and it can be used in a variety of robotics and automation projects.
